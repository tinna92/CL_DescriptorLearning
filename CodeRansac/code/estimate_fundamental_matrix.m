% Returns the camera center matrix for a given projection matrix

% 'Points_a' is nx2 matrix of 2D coordinate of points on Image A
% 'Points_b' is nx2 matrix of 2D coordinate of points on Image B
% 'F_matrix' is 3x3 fundamental matrix

% Try to implement this function as efficiently as possible. It will be
% called repeatly for part III of the project

function [ F_matrix ] = estimate_fundamental_matrix(Points_a,Points_b)
