% Find the best fundamental matrix using RANSAC on potentially matching
% points

% 'matches_a' and 'matches_b' are the Nx2 coordinates of the possibly
% matching points from pic_a and pic_b. Each row is a correspondence (e.g.
% row 42 of matches_a is a point that corresponds to row 42 of matches_b.

% 'Best_Fmatrix' is the 3x3 fundamental matrix
% 'inliers_a' and 'inliers_b' are the Mx2 corresponding points (some subset
% of 'matches_a' and 'matches_b') that are inliers with respect to
% Best_Fmatrix.

% For this section, use RANSAC to find the best fundamental matrix by
% randomly sample interest points. You would reuse
% estimate_fundamental_matrix() from part 2 of this assignment.

% If you are trying to produce an uncluttered visualization of epipolar
% lines, you may want to return no more than 30 points for either left or
% right images.

function [ Best_Fmatrix, inliers_a, inliers_b] = ransac_fundamental_matrix(matches_a, matches_b)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Your code here
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Your ransac loop should contain a call to 'estimate_fundamental_matrix()'
% that you wrote for part II.

%placeholders, you can delete all of this
Best_Fmatrix = estimate_fundamental_matrix(matches_a(1:10,:), matches_b(1:10,:));
inliers_a = matches_a(1:30,:);
inliers_b = matches_b(1:30,:);
