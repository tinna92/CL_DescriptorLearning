% there is a big difference between SIFT descriptor and SiameseCNN. In
% SIFT, the dominent direction is calculated and any other direction that
% is over 80% of the most dominent direction will also be assigned as
% dominant directions. In this case, there will be more than 1 dominent
% directions for some feature and hence more than one descirptors for some
% feature. However, in Siamese CNN, the dominant direction is not
% considered in the training data, at least not seriously, so there is a
% need to make some special ground truth matching data for SiameCNN
% architecture since it has only one descriptor for each detector.

% to get these ground truth, 1) get the homography matrix in the data;
% 2)calculate the point correspondence of each feature in the first image
% and get its corresponding feature index by comparision using eucalidean
% distances. 3) build the ground truth matching data for each pair of
% images. The comparison is only based on coordinate difference so far.
