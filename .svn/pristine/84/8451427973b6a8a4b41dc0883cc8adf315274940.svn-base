test the influence of threshold l_pull and l_push


firstly, the following test could be done:
1) How l_pull and l_push influence the performance of the learning descriptor?
test the following cases:
l_pull = 0, l_push = 10
l_pull = 1, l_push = 10 6.4% (0,10 for sort and 1,10 for mining)
l_pull = 3, l_push = 10 8.6%
l_pull = 5, l_push = 10 10.1%
l_pull = 7, l_push = 10 


(Train: Liberty 0,10 for sort  (1,10 with mining) ,mining to 125 (from 1000))
test : Notreme 6.4%, Yosemite 10.9%) without saving theta,
then test mining with 0 and 10.


2) Test the influence of coefficients before C_s and C_ds, namely the relative ratio of similar and dissimilar cost.
